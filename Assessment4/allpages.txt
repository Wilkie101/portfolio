Background / What has happened?

The ACSC is tracking three vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, CVE-2021-31207 known collectively as 
ProxyShell) in Microsoft Exchange Servers that allow for unauthenticated remote code execution and arbitrary file 
upload with elevated privileges.

It is likely that threat actors will actively exploit these vulnerabilities against vulnerable Microsoft Exchange 
Servers.

CVE-2021-34473 provides a mechanism for pre-authentication remote code execution, enabling malicious actors to remotely 
execute code on an affected system. 
CVE-2021-34523 enables malicious actors to execute arbitrary code post-authentication on Microsoft Exchange servers due 
to a flaw in the PowerShell service not properly validating access tokens.
CVE-2021-31207 enables post-authentication malicious actors to execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM and 
write arbitrary files.


Microsoft released patches to these vulnerabilities in April and May 2021.

 Background /What has happened?

The ACSC is tracking a vulnerability in BlackBerry QNX RTOS on Australian networks.


An integer overflow vulnerability exists in BlackBerry’s QNX products (including standard, medical and 
safety-certified versions).  This vulnerability could allow remote code execution or denial-of-service attacks. This 
is a high-risk vulnerability, affecting QNX SDP 6.5 SP1 and below (shipped in products manufactured between 1996 to 
2012) and QNX for safety manufactured until 2018.

Whether exploitation is possible depends on the presence of an external connection, and whether compensating controls 
otherwise protect the device. Impact is implementation specific. The ACSC recommends users take defensive measures such 
as those detailed in the Protecting Industrial Control Systems publication to minimize the risk of exploitation.

BlackBerry has released a list of affected products. It is difficult to know what downstream products use QNX as 
original equipment manufacturers (OEM) build and deploy QNX downstream. Since OEMs can modify the code, patches may be 
specific to OEM products, rather than simply a generic QNX patch.

The ACSC has observed a growing trend affecting construction companies and their customers. In the past six months 
there has been an increase in cybercriminals targeting builders and construction companies to conduct business email 
compromise (BEC) scams within Australia.

In a BEC scam, cybercriminals will send fraudulent emails posing as a legitimate business. These emails typically 
target the customers of the business and will ask them to change bank account details for future invoice payments. 
Victims assume this request is legitimate and will then send invoice payments to a bank account operated by the scammer.

These fraudulent emails may come from hacked email accounts, or cybercriminals might register domain names that are 
similar to legitimate companies (typically by swapping letters or adding additional characters). At a quick glance, an 
email address may look legitimate when it is actually being operated by a cybercriminal.

Successful BECs may go unnoticed for weeks or months until the construction company follows up on missing payments.
Mitigation

All parties to construction projects should be vigilant when communicating by email, particularly when discussing bank 
account details or invoicing.

Other mitigation strategies include:

Verify payment-related requests: If you receive a request to make a large transfer or to change bank account details, 
you should verify that the request is legitimate before actioning it. Call the sender's established phone number or 
visit them face-to-face before transferring any funds.
Secure your email account: It is recommended that construction companies and related businesses use strong passphrases 
and enable multi-factor authentication on their email accounts.

The ACSC is aware of phone calls and emails from scammers claiming to be ACSC employees or stating they are working in 
collaboration with the ACSC. Scammers are calling from ‘spoofed’ Australian phone numbers, offering to resolve 
malware issues or requesting assistance in the apprehension of cybercriminals.

The scammers are requesting individuals download remote access applications such as ‘TeamViewer’ or ‘AnyDesk’ 
giving the scammer access to the individual’s computer. The scammer will then persuade the individual into revealing 
sensitive personal information by asking for copies of identity documents, or by suggesting the individual to log into 
their bank account.

Further to the calls, cybercriminals are masquerading as ACSC members in emails requesting recipients download 
‘Antivirus’ software through a malicious link. If clicked on, the link downloads and installs malicious software to 
the individual’s computer.

Scammers may also request the purchase of cryptocurrencies or gift cards to ‘help stop the criminals’, requesting 
secrecy, or threatening to arrest individuals who do not comply.

If you have fallen victim to these phone calls or emails and paid money or exposed personal information, you can lodge

Background

On 14 December 2020, the ACSC issued an initial alert regarding potential compromise of the SolarWinds Orion 
software. This alert was informed by an announcement from cyber security company FireEye, who were monitoring a global 
intrusion campaign linked to compromise of the SolarWinds Orion software supply chain. 
Update

As of 25 January 2021, the ACSC has received a number of reports from Australian organisations notifying that they were 
operating vulnerable versions of SolarWinds Orion. To date, no follow-on compromise of an Australian organisation 
through SolarWinds Orion has been identified.

The compromise of the supply chain meant that that organisations that were running SolarWinds Orion may have 
inadvertently installed malicious additions through normal update processes. The malicious software (malware) 
associated with the supply chain compromise is being referred to as SUNBURST. 

Following the identification of SUNBURST, additional malware associated with the SolarWinds Orion supply chain 
compromise has been identified. These are commonly being referred to as TEARDROP and RAINDROP and have been identified 
during investigations of follow-on compromises of affected organisations. 

During investigations of the supply chain compromise, additional malware targeting SolarWinds Orion was 
identified. This second set of malicious software is being referred to as SUPERNOVA. The SUPERNOVA malware is not 
believed to be related to the supply chain compromise, instead targeting an unrelated vulnerability in SolarWinds Orion.
Mitigation

SolarWinds have identified the vulnerabilities exploited by the compromise and issued patches for affected SolarWinds 
Orion versions.

Accordingly, ACSC’s recommendation for mitigating potentially vulnerable versions of SolarWinds Orion is to apply the 
latest patches from SolarWinds as soon as possible. This recommendation applies to mitigate against both the SUNBURST 
and SUPERNOVA malware.

The ACSC has observed increased targeting activity against the Australian health sector by actors using the SDBBot 
Remote Access Tool (RAT).

SDBBot is comprised of 3 components; an installer which establishes persistence, a loader which downloads additional 
components, and the RAT itself. Once installed, malicious actors will use SDBBot to move laterally within a network and 
exfiltrate data. SDBBot is a known precursor of the Clop ransomware.

While the recently observed activity is targeting the health sector, the ACSC recommends that all network owners review 
their controls against ransomware as per ACSC’s publication Ransomware in Australia.









**********************************************************************************

Alert status

The Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre has identified a sustained campaign by 
sophisticated cybercrime actors impacting the Australian health sector. We continue to see activity against the health 
sector similar to the increase of identified Emotet activity in Advisory 2020-17: Resumption of Emotet malware campaign.

This type of campaign is not limited to Australia, with the United States of America Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency (CISA) recently issuing a cyber security alert. This alert identifies a campaign, with Emotet and 
TrickBot being used to further deploy Conti or Ryuk ransomware variants. The alert also provides detection and 
mitigation advice.

While this campaign is targeted at the health sector, the ACSC recommends that all Australian organisations read the 
two documents linked above and follow their recommended mitigation advice.









**********************************************************************************

Alert status

Emotet provides an attacker with a foothold in a network from which additional attacks can be performed, often leading 
to further compromise through the deployment of ransomware.
How it works

The Emotet malware appears as a normal or useful file attachment in emails (.doc, .docx, .pdf), but includes hidden 
code which allows cybercriminals to access and control your devices or computer systems. It can also appear as a 
website hyperlink in emails.

Emotet malware infects devices or computers if users click on links or open files in these emails, which are sent as 
phishing emails to make them look like they come from someone you know, or an organisation you deal with.

Once a user account is infected, the malware forwards itself to all the users’ email contacts, increasing the 
likelihood of further infection.







**********************************************************************************

Alert status

Proof of concept code to exploit the vulnerability is now freely available online and has been integrated into common 
exploit frameworks and tools.

CVE-2020-1472 also affects several other products not previously covered by the advisory including, but not limited to:

Samba implementations on Linux systems prior to v4.8. This includes all Linux distributions that utilise the official 
Samba packages.


In most cases, CVE-2020-1472 is a privilege escalation vulnerability. However, adversaries may be able exploit the 
vulnerability for initial access if a Domain Controller is internet-exposed.

**********************************************************************************

Alert status
HIGH



The Australian Government is aware of, and responding to, a sustained targeting of Australian governments and companies 
by a sophisticated state-based actor. 

The title ‘Copy-paste compromises’ is derived from the actor’s heavy use of proof-of-concept exploit code, web 
shells and other tools copied almost identically from open source.

The actor has been identified leveraging a number of initial access vectors, with the most prevalent being the 
exploitation of public-facing infrastructure — primarily through the use of remote code execution vulnerabilities in 
unpatched versions of Telerik UI. Other vulnerabilities in public-facing infrastructure leveraged by the actor include 
exploitation of a deserialisation vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), a 2019 SharePoint 
vulnerability and the 2019 Citrix vulnerability.

The actor has shown the capability to quickly leverage public exploit proof-of-concepts to target networks of interest 
and regularly conducts reconnaissance of target networks looking for vulnerable services, potentially maintaining a 
list of public-facing services to quickly target following future vulnerability releases. The actor has also shown an 
aptitude for identifying development, test and orphaned services that are not well known or maintained by victim 
organisations.

When the exploitation of public-facing infrastructure did not succeed, the ACSC has identified the actor utilising 
various spearphishing techniques. This spearphishing has taken the form of:

links to credential harvesting websites
emails with links to malicious files, or with the malicious file directly attached
links prompting users to grant Office 365 OAuth tokens to the actor
use of email tracking services to identify the email opening and lure click-through events.

What’s happened?

The Australian Cyber Security Centre and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s Scamwatch have received an 
increased number of reports in the last five days of remote access scams.

Members of the public have reported receiving calls from cybercriminals pretending to be from telecommunication 
companies, government agencies including the Department of Home Affairs, and parcel delivery companies.

A majority of the calls have been reported by people living in areas that have been locked down due to the COVID-19 
pandemic, suggesting cybercriminals may be preying on people who are more vulnerable, housebound and easy to contact. 
   

Where victims have handed over personal details, the cybercriminals are then using legitimate remote access 
applications, like Team Viewer or Zoho Assist, to gain access to people’s devices. They then log into your bank 
account and online accounts, and steal your details for financial gain. 
Does it affect me?

Cybercriminals are cold calling people, so anyone can receive one of these calls, regardless of whether you have any 
usual dealings with the business being impersonated.

The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is receiving increased reports of several myGov-related SMS and email scams.

At this time of year, when people expect some form of interaction with the ATO during tax time, be aware that 
cybercriminals take advantage by pretending to be the ATO or myGov. These scams look like they’ve come from an ATO or 
myGov email address and they ask you to click on a link to verify your details.



To make them seem more legitimate, cybercriminals use technology that causes these messages to appear in the same 
conversation thread as genuine messages from the ATO or myGov. The image is an example of this scam message.

If clicked on, the hyperlink takes you to a fake website that asks you to provide your details and other personal

The threats in question are delivered via email, and threaten the recipient with a sustained DoS attack unless a sum of 
the Monero cryptocurrency is paid. The actors behind these threats claim to be the ‘Silence Hacking Crew', however 
the ACSC is unable to verify this claim.

The ACSC cannot positively verify the legitimacy of any threats made by the actor. However, the ACSC has received no 
reports of the threats eventuating in DoS and is aware of a number of DoS threats made in the past against Australian 
organisations that did not eventuate.

Details

Telerik offers a variety of products which are used to provide functionality used by web pages. In some cases, Telerik 
products may be installed as a third party component through other products, and as such, may be unknowingly in use.

In 2017, a security vulnerability was published that affects some Telerik products which could allow a malicious cyber 
actor to gain control over a server. This vulnerability is detailed in CVE-2017-9248, and similarly in CVE-2017-11317 
and CVE-2017-11357. Vulnerable versions of Telerik are those published between 2007 and 2017.

Telerik issued a patch for these vulnerabilities in 2017, however due to the nature of the software, the patches may 
need to be manually applied.

The tools to exploit this vulnerability have been publicly published and require only basic knowledge or skills to use 
successfully. Any servers currently running a vulnerable version should be considered at risk and remediation steps 
should be taken.

Opportunistic malicious actors are exploiting people’s concerns and desire for information about the COVID-19 
pandemic by directing them towards websites designed to either install malicious software or steal personal 
information. In the last few weeks, the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) has observed thousands of 
COVID-19-related websites being registered. While the majority of these websites are legitimate, many are being created 
by malicious cyber actors seeking to exploit Australians during this difficult time.

The malicious COVID-19 websites are designed to look legitimate or impersonate well-known organisations, making it 
difficult for individuals to detect. Cybercriminals use them to install computer viruses onto people’s devices, such 
as banking Trojans or different variants of ransomware, in order to generate profit. In other cases, they seek to 
harvest user credentials, such as personal identification, passwords and bank details, which are then used to gain 
access to the user’s networks, devices or online financial accounts.  

The ACSC, with assistance from our law enforcement and industry partners, is engaged in efforts to disrupt or prevent 
these malicious COVID-19 themed cyber activities. Ongoing analysis of COVID-19 scams and phishing emails indicates the 
majority of them are quite sophisticated, often impersonating trusted entities such as the Australian Government. The 
methods used are constantly evolving, with malicious actors regularly adapting their tradecraft to circumvent attempts 
to stop them.

Those engaged in cybercrime activity are not constrained by geographic borders and their actions can have far-reaching 
consequences. The ACSC is aware of reports that malicious actors based in Eastern and Western Europe, Asia and Africa 
have been responsible for launching COVID-19 themed malicious cyber activity, including against Australians. 

The ACSC strongly encourages organisations and individuals to remain vigilant against the threat of COVID-19 themed 
scams, phishing emails and malicious websites.

The Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) notes that actors have attempted to use 
this exploit against a number of federal and state government agencies.

The ACSC is aware that sophisticated actors are actively exploiting a deserialisation vulnerability existing in all 
versions of Microsoft’s Internet Information Services (IIS) using the .NET framework (.NET). The vulnerability 
exploits the service’s VIEWSTATE parameter to allow for remote code execution by unauthorised users.

For actors to successfully exploit this vulnerability, they need to craft a VIEWSTATE parameter with malicious content. 
On up-to-date installs of .NET on IIS, the contents of this parameter are protected by Message Authentication Code 
(MAC) validation and an actor must obtain the IIS server Machine Key to exploit this vulnerability.

The ACSC has observed active targeting of organisations that have been previously compromised, implying that 
configuration files and associated keys may have been exfiltrated while the actor was present on systems running IIS.

The ACSC has also observed active targeting of organisations running other vulnerable software components, such as 
Telerik, that can also provide access to the required key material to perform decryption. For more information on this 
malicious use of Telerik, please refer to ACSC Advisory 2020-004: Targeting of Telerik CVE-2019-18935 and ACSC Advisory 
2019-126: Vulnerable version of Telerik UI being actively exploited by APT actor.

The ACSC has not observed the activity detailed in this advisory targeting Microsoft Exchange Servers, however, the 
ACSC is aware of CVE-2020-0688 which would allow an actor to know the Machine Key for Microsoft Exchange Servers 
without gaining access to the key on the server. It is important to note that patches outlined in Microsoft advisory 
CVE-2020-0688 address the static Machine Key and do not mitigate the deserialisation vulnerability if the Machine Key 
becomes known.

This advisory provides indicators of the activity ACSC has observed and details proactive advice on detecting and 
mitigating potential exploitation of this vulnerability.

This advisory provides a summary of notable tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) exploited by Advanced Persistent 
Threats (APT) and cybercriminals identified during the ACSC’s investigations.

These TTPs are summarised practically in the framework of tactics and techniques provided by MITRE ATT&amp;CK.

This technical guidance is provided for IT security professionals at public and private sector organisations.

Overview

As the outbreak of the virus continues to impact the health sectors of countries worldwide, APT groups may be seeking 
information and intellectual property relating to vaccine development, treatments, research and responses to the 
outbreak as this information is now of higher value and priority globally. Accordingly, Australia’s health or 
research sectors could be at greater threat of being targeted, and potentially compromised, by malicious APT groups.

Due to the increased pressure placed on the health sector to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical that 
health sector organisations ensure that their networks are protected from malicious cyber actors who may seek to 
disrupt essential services or compromise business-critical systems.

Sophisticated actors will often use the most efficient means available to target a victim’s network and, in the 
current climate, APT groups may seek to maximise on the public desire for COVID-19 related information by generating 
specific COVID-19 themed spear-phishing emails to attempt to compromise victims.

Adversaries and cybercrime actors have been identified as responsible for compromising email servers of health sector 
entities in Australia, which are then used to distribute COVID-19 phishing emails in an attempt to deploy malicious 
software, including ransomware, or to gain access to other targeted organisations.

Malicious actors view health sector entities as a lucrative target for ransomware attacks. This is because of the 
sensitive personal and medical data they hold, and how critical this data is to maintaining operations and patient 
care. A significant ransomware attack against a hospital network would have major impact.

Sophisticated actors have also been seen undertaking brute force attacks using a trial-and-error method to guess login 
credentials, and password spray attacks that attempt to access numerous accounts with a list of commonly-used 
passwords. Attacks such as these often result in the theft of sensitive data, and underscore the importance of a strong 
cyber security culture amongst employees. This includes adopting multi-factor authentication, strong password policies, 
and regular reviews of network logs for signs of malicious activity.

The exploitation of compromised Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials by malicious actors is also a significant 
concern, particularly as RDP is widely used by medical clinics and doctors’ surgeries to access centralised patient 
databases and other shared information repositories. Compromised RDP credentials can enable unauthorised access to 
networks in a manner that enables the malicious actor’s digital footprint and identification to be obscured.

Organisations should implement the recommendations in this advisory in order to mitigate the threat of this malicious 
activity and harden their network against unauthorised access. The ACSC also recommends that organisations consider the 
recent joint advice provided by the NCSC-UK and CISA-US:

The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) is warning Australians to be alert to the scam after receiving more than 
1,900 reports of the emails since 9 April.

The email scammers may also claim to have compromised a computer or other electronic device, and may include either a 
full or partial password that the recipient has used in the past.

Sextortion is a form of online blackmail where a perpetrator threatens to reveal intimate images of someone online, 
often to their friends and family, unless they pay a ransom (commonly in cryptocurrency). Typically, the scammers have 
no compromising information.

The spam emails appear to have begun on 9 April, with most recipients receiving their messages on this or the following 
day.  The name of the ‘sender’ was different in each instance of the email address, the ACSC has confirmed.

While the ACSC has not received any reports of financial loss, Australians are urged to not make payments, to cease all 
contact with the scammers, and delete the email.

At this time, the ACSC is unaware whether these incidents are indicative of a broader campaign.
Details

Currently, the ACSC has limited information about the initial intrusion vector for Mailto infections.

There is some evidence that Mailto actors may have used phishing and password spray attacks, and then used compromised 
accounts to send further phishing emails to the users address book to spread the malware.

There is currently limited information from this compromise on how the malware is spread laterally across a network.

The hash of the Mailto ransomware from this incident is available in the Indicators of Compromise section of this 
advisory.

The ACSC is continuing to monitor the situation and will update this advisory with any additional details.

Security researchers have developed methods involving speculative execution to read kernel memory from user space on a 
variety of processors from a range of vendors produced in the last decade. These methods have been referred to as 
Meltdown and Spectre.

Meltdown is described as a vulnerability that allows a program to access the memory, and thus also the secrets, of 
other programs and the operating system. Meltdown only impacts Intel chips.

Spectre allows access to protected memory of other applications. Spectre impacts Intel, AMD and ARM chips, which 
includes some mobile devices.

The vulnerabilities

Tracked as CVE-2020-0601, CVE-2020-0609, CVE-2020-0610 and CVE-2020-0611, these vulnerabilities were announced along 
with patches on 15 January 2020 (AEDT) as part of Microsoft's January 2020 security updates.
CVE-2020-0601 – Important

The certificate validation vulnerability exists in the way Windows CryptoAPI (Crypt32.dll) validates Elliptic Curve 
Cryptography (ECC) certificates. It could allow an adversary to spoof a code-signing or TLS certificate and have it 
appear as valid, in addition this vulnerability may allow remote code execution. This Microsoft security patch also 
creates a new log event with event ID 1 in the Windows Application event log to record the attempted exploitation of 
this vulnerability.
CVE-2020-0609 and CVE-2020-0610 – Critical

CVE-2020-0609 and CVE-2020-0610 both contain a remote code execution vulnerability which exists in Windows Remote 
Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway) where an unauthenticated attacker can connect to the RD Gateway over RDP and send 
specially crafted requests to the target system. This can allow a malicious actor to install software, modify/create 
user accounts, or modify data on the RD Gateway.
CVE-2020-0611 - Critical

CVE-2020-0611 is a remote code execution vulnerability which exists in the Windows Remote Desktop Client. When a user 
connects to a malicious server via RDP, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability and execute arbitrary code on the 
connecting computer as the user. This can allow an adversary to install software, modify/create user accounts, or 
modify data on a client's computer.

What’s happened?


These fake SMS messages may tell you that your parcel is ‘detained’, ‘you’ve missed a delivery’ or there’s 
an ‘important update’ to your delivery – and include a link to click on for more details. As scammers use 
technology that imitates a caller ID, these scam texts can even appear in the same conversation thread as a legitimate 
Australia Post conversation.


By clicking on the links in a scam message, you are usually taken to a fake Australia Post website to enter your 
personal or financial details. Clicking on these links can also infect your device with malicious software (malware).

The password spray attacks target users on standard corporate external services such as webmail, remote desktop access, 
Active Directory Federated Services (ADFS) or cloud based services such as Office 365. Depending on the credentials and 
service, successful authentication can potentially lead to the actor gaining access to corporate emails, the corporate 
directory, global address books, remote desktop services or administrative access.

The ACSC, Office of the eSafety Commissioner and Scamwatch have received over 300 reports this week.

This scam email may appear to originate from an individual’s own email address and threatens to release personal and 
sensitive information unless the scammer is paid money. The email may also claim to have compromised a computer, router 
or other electronic device and it can include a password which the recipient has used in the past.

Sextortion is a form of online blackmail where a perpetrator threatens to reveal intimate images of someone online, 
often to their friends and family, unless they pay a ransom (commonly in untraceable cryptocurrency). Typically, the 
scammers have no compromising information.

While the ACSC has not received any reports of financial loss, the centre would like to remind Australians to not make 
payments and cease all contact with the scammers.

This exposure may lead to data contained in these services being compromised. The ACSC urges organisations to check 
their externally facing internet services and ensure appropriate access controls and protections are in place.
Details

As part of the ACSC, the Australian Internet Security Initiative (AISI) operates as a public-private partnership where 
Australian internet providers and other network owners voluntarily work with the ACSC to help protect their customers 
and/or themselves from cyber security threats.

The program helps to reduce malicious software (malware) infections and service vulnerabilities occurring on Australian 
IP address ranges. Daily email reports are sent to internet providers identifying IP addresses on their networks 
observed as being infected by malware or potentially vulnerable to exploitation. Internet providers are encouraged to 
use the AISI data to identify and inform affected customers about their malware infection or service vulnerability. 
This includes providing advice to customers on how they can remove the malware or secure the vulnerable service.

Over recent weeks, the ACSC has received a number of reports about cyber security incidents that could have been 
prevented if the affected party had signed up to the free AISI program and actioned the alert data it provides.

The web-facing services reported through the AISI are often vulnerable because they have inadequate authentication and 
access control processes in place. Malicious actors are known to exploit these types of vulnerable services in order to 
commit further cyber attacks such as:

Ransomware Theft and/or modification of data and intellectual property
Business disruption
Denial of Service attacks
