Background / What has happened?

The ACSC is tracking three vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, CVE-2021-31207 known collectively as 
ProxyShell) in Microsoft Exchange Servers that allow for unauthenticated remote code execution and arbitrary file 
upload with elevated privileges.

It is likely that threat actors will actively exploit these vulnerabilities against vulnerable Microsoft Exchange 
Servers.

CVE-2021-34473 provides a mechanism for pre-authentication remote code execution, enabling malicious actors to remotely 
execute code on an affected system. 
CVE-2021-34523 enables malicious actors to execute arbitrary code post-authentication on Microsoft Exchange servers due 
to a flaw in the PowerShell service not properly validating access tokens.
CVE-2021-31207 enables post-authentication malicious actors to execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM and 
write arbitrary files.


Microsoft released patches to these vulnerabilities in April and May 2021.

Additional information can be found in the Microsoft advisories:

 Background /What has happened?

The ACSC is tracking a vulnerability in BlackBerry QNX RTOS on Australian networks.


An integer overflow vulnerability exists in BlackBerry’s QNX products (including standard, medical and 
safety-certified versions).  This vulnerability could allow remote code execution or denial-of-service attacks. This 
is a high-risk vulnerability, affecting QNX SDP 6.5 SP1 and below (shipped in products manufactured between 1996 to 
2012) and QNX for safety manufactured until 2018.

Whether exploitation is possible depends on the presence of an external connection, and whether compensating controls 
otherwise protect the device. Impact is implementation specific. The ACSC recommends users take defensive measures such 
as those detailed in the Protecting Industrial Control Systems publication to minimize the risk of exploitation.

BlackBerry has released a list of affected products. It is difficult to know what downstream products use QNX as 
original equipment manufacturers (OEM) build and deploy QNX downstream. Since OEMs can modify the code, patches may be 
specific to OEM products, rather than simply a generic QNX patch.

View further information on this vulnerability.
Mitigation / How do I stay secure? 

Australian organisations should review their networks for use of vulnerable instances of  BlackBerry QNX RTOS and 
implement the following mitigation advice.
Apply available vendor updates.

Manufacturers of products that incorporate vulnerable versions should contact BlackBerry or their direct reseller to 
obtain the patch code.
Manufacturers of products who develop unique versions of RTOS software should contact BlackBerry to obtain the patch 
code but may need to develop and test their own software patches.

Background /What has happened?

SonicWall, a network and cyber security appliance vendor, is reporting that ransomware activity is currently targeting 
their Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 series comprised of SMA 200, 210, 400, 410 physical appliances and the SMA 500v 
virtual appliance) and Secure Remote Access (SRA) products running unpatched and end-of-life 8.x firmware versions. 
This ransomware activity is reported by SonicWall as abusing stolen credentials.

The ACSC is aware of stolen credentials affecting Australian organisations that were likely the result of unpatched and 
end-of-life SonicWall devices running 8.x firmware being exploited.

The ACSC has previously issued an alert on a remote credential access vulnerability affecting SonicWall products.

Update 29 July 2021

This alert update clarifies that only end-of-life and selected unpatched devices are vulnerable to this activity.

Mitigation / How do I stay secure? 

Australian organisations should review their networks for the presence of affected SonicWall products which are 
outlined in the security notice from SonicWall. If vulnerable products are identified, Australian organisations should 
review and implement the recommended mitigations provided by SonicWall.

Assistance / Where can I go for help?

The ACSC is monitoring the situation and is able to provide assistance and advice as required. Organisations that have 
been impacted or require assistance can contact the ACSC via 1300 CYBER1.
