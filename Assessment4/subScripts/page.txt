This exposure may lead to data contained in these services being compromised. The ACSC urges organisations to check their externally facing internet services and ensure appropriate access controls and protections are in place.
Details

As part of the ACSC, the Australian Internet Security Initiative (AISI) operates as a public-private partnership where Australian internet providers and other network owners voluntarily work with the ACSC to help protect their customers and/or themselves from cyber security threats.

The program helps to reduce malicious software (malware) infections and service vulnerabilities occurring on Australian IP address ranges. Daily email reports are sent to internet providers identifying IP addresses on their networks observed as being infected by malware or potentially vulnerable to exploitation. Internet providers are encouraged to use the AISI data to identify and inform affected customers about their malware infection or service vulnerability. This includes providing advice to customers on how they can remove the malware or secure the vulnerable service.

Over recent weeks, the ACSC has received a number of reports about cyber security incidents that could have been prevented if the affected party had signed up to the free AISI program and actioned the alert data it provides.

The web-facing services reported through the AISI are often vulnerable because they have inadequate authentication and access control processes in place. Malicious actors are known to exploit these types of vulnerable services in order to commit further cyber attacks such as:

Ransomware Theft and/or modification of data and intellectual property
Business disruption
Denial of Service attacks
