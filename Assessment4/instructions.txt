Very simply run the webScraper.sh

Password is=1

Very poor password strength I know but it is there to highlight it can be done.

Main script:

webScraper.sh

subScripts called from the main:

alertType.sh
critTable.sh
curlAll.sh
extract.sh
keyWordType.sh
setPassword.sh
showHeadline.sh
urlCase.sh
wordtable.sh

For testing I manually reset the working test files as it proved functionality

resettextfiles.sh


I have included urlCase.sh as well, it is my failure, the script i could not get working, it would just take 
time to do, which in the end i ran out of :).
